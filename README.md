# jobSearchToolAlpha

This is the first proof of concept/MVP of a tool I'm creating to make my future job searches easier. This is purely frontend and has hard coded list of companies.

In the future I'd like this to be full-stack and have these features:

* User auth to keep lists separate
* Different Search Lists for different job searches
* Ability to create and add companies to be searched
* Ability to change search terms to search with name of company
* Notes on job individual companies
* Ability to check when completed and change color of that company
